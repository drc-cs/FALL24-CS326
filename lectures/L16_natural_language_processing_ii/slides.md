## Agenda

To date, we have explored traditional machine learning models and not discussed many state-of-the-art approaches. For many tasks, classical models are usually very effective and serve as steadfast baselines for nearly any data science project. However, for data science tasks involving text data (e.g., information retrieval, text summarization, question-answering, etc.) recent advances far surpass the capabilities of traditional models.

So today, we will discuss a modern NLP approach called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines the strengths of information retrieval (IR) systems with large language models (LLMs) to create a powerful tool for working with text data in a variety of applications. 

Learning RAG will also introduce longstanding concepts that are critical for modern NLP applications -- including **tokenization**, **chunking**, **embedding**, **vector storage**, **vector retrieval**, and **LLM text generation**.

<!--s-->

## Motivation | RAG

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. We will discuss LLMs in more detail later in this lecture. However, for now it's important to note that modern LLMs have some severe limitations, including:

- **Inability to access external knowledge**
- **Hallucinations** (generating text that is not grounded in reality)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of information retrieval systems with LLMs.

<!--s-->

## Motivation | RAG

So what is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

1. **Retrieval**: A storage & retrieval system that obtains context-relevant documents from a database.
2. **Generation**: A large language model that generates text based on the obtained documents.

## Motivation | Creating an Expert Chatbot 🤖

<div style = "font-size: 0.8em;">

Our goal today is to build a RAG system that will answer questions about Northwestern's policy on academic integrity. To do this, we will:

1. **Tokenize** a document.<br>
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens. We'll learn how GPT-4 tokenizes text, and do the same.

2. **Chunk** the document into smaller, searchable units.<br>
Chunking is the process of creating windows of text that can be indexed and searched. We'll learn how to chunk text to make it compatible with a vector database.

3. **Embed** the text chunks.<br>
Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic information. We'll learn how to embed chunks using OpenAI's embedding model (and others!).

4. **Store and Retrieve** the embeddings from a vector database.<br>
We'll store the embeddings in a vector database and retrieve relevant documents based on the current context of a conversation. We'll demo with chromadb.

5. **Generate** text using the retrieved chunks and conversation context.<br>
We'll generate text with GPT-4 based on the retrieved chunks and a provided query, using OpenAI's API.

## Tokenize

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters. Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP because it allows us to work with text data in a structured way.

Some traditional tokenization strategies include:

- **Word Tokenization**. E.g. <span class="code-span">"Hello, world!" -> ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"] -> [12, 4, 56, 3]</span>
- **Subword Tokenization**. E.g. <span class="code-span">"unbelievable" -> ["un", "believable"] -> [34, 56]</span>
- **Character Tokenization**. E.g. <span class="code-span">"Hello!" -> ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "!"] -> [92, 34, 56, 56, 12, 4]</span>

One common, modern tokenization strategy is **Byte Pair Encoding(BPE)**, which is used by many large language models.

<!--s-->

## Tokenize | Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

BPE is a subword tokenization algorithm that builds a vocabulary of subwords by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of characters.

BPE is a powerful tokenization algorithm because it can handle rare words and out-of-vocabulary words. It is used by many large language models, including GPT-4. The algorithm is as follows:

```text
1. Initialize the vocabulary with all characters in the text.
2. While the vocabulary size is less than the desired size:
    a. Compute the frequency of all character pairs.
    b. Merge the most frequent pair.
    c. Update the vocabulary with the merged pair.
```

<!--s-->

## Tokenize | Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with TikToken

One BPE implementation can be found in the `tiktoken` library, which is an open-source library from OpenAI.

```python

import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base") # Get specific encoding used by GPT-4.
enc.encode("Hello, world!") # Returns the tokenized text.

## Chunk

<div style = "font-size: 0.8em;">

Chunking is the process of creating windows of text that can be indexed and searched. Chunking is essential for information retrieval systems because it allows us to break down large documents into smaller, searchable units.

<div class = "col-wrapper">

<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; height: 100%;">


### Sentence Chunking

Sentence chunking is the process of breaking text into sentences.

E.g. <span class="code-span">"Hello, world! How are you?" -> ["Hello, world!", "How are you?"]</span>

### Paragraph Chunking

Paragraph chunking is the process of breaking text into paragraphs.

E.g. <span class="code-span">"Hello, world! \n Nice to meet you." -> ["Hello, world!", "Nice to meet you."]</span>

### Agent Chunking

Agent chunking is the process of breaking text down using an LLM.

</div>

<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%; height: 100%;">

### Sliding Word / Token Window Chunking

Sliding window chunking is a simple chunking strategy that creates windows of text by sliding a window of a fixed size over the text.

E.g. <span class="code-span">"The cat in the hat" -> ["The cat in", "cat in the", "in the hat"]</span>

### Semantic Chunking

Semantic chunking is the process of breaking text into semantically meaningful units.

E.g. <span class="code-span">"The cat in the hat. One of my favorite books." -> ["The cat in the hat.", "One of my favorite books."]</span>

## Chunk | NLTK Sentence Chunking

NLTK is a powerful library for natural language processing that provides many tools for text processing. NLTK provides a sentence tokenizer that can be used to chunk text into sentences.

### Chunking with NLTK

```python
from nltk import sent_tokenize

# Load Academic Integrity document.
doc = open('/Users/joshua/Desktop/academic_integrity.md').read()

# Split the document into sentences.
chunked_data = sent_tokenize(doc)
```

## Embed

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic information. Word embeddings are essential for many NLP tasks because they allow us to work with words in a continuous and meaningful vector space.

**Traditional embeddings** such as Word2Vec are static and pre-trained on large text corpora.

**Contextual embeddings** such as those used by BERT and GPT are dynamic and trained on large language modeling tasks.

<!--s-->

## Embed | Traditional Word Embeddings

Word2Vec is a traditional word embedding model that learns word vectors by predicting the context of a word. Word2Vec has two standard architectures:

- **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**. Predicts a word given its context.
- **Skip-gram**. Predicts the context given a word.

Word2Vec is trained on large text corpora and produces dense word vectors that capture semantic information. The result of Word2Vec is a mapping from words to vectors, where similar words are close together in the vector space.

<span style="font-size: 0.6em; padding-top: 0.5em; text-align: center; display: block; color: grey;">Braun 2017</span>

<!--s-->

## Embed | Contextual Word Embeddings

Contextual word embeddings are word embeddings that are dependent on the context in which the word appears. Contextual word embeddings are essential for many NLP tasks because they capture the *contextual* meaning of words in a sentence.

For example, the word "bank" can have different meanings depending on the context:

- **"I went to the bank to deposit my paycheck."**
- **"The river bank was covered in mud."**

[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) contains a [MTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316) leaderboard for some of the most popular contextual word embeddings:

<span style="font-size: 0.6em; padding-top: 0.5em; text-align: center; display: block; color: grey;">HuggingFace, 2024</span>

<!--s-->

## Embed | OpenAI's Embedding Model

OpenAI provides an embedding model via API that can embed text into a dense vector space. The model is trained on a large text corpus and can embed text into a n-dimensional vector space.

```python
import openai

openai_client = openai.Client(api_key = os.environ['API_KEY'])
embeddings = openai_client.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-large", documents=chunked_data)
```


🔥 Although they do not top the MTEB leaderboard, OpenAI's embeddings work well and the convenience of the API makes them a popular choice for many applications.

## Store & Retrieve

A vector database is a database that stores embeddings and allows for fast similarity search. Vector databases are essential for information retrieval systems because they enable us to *quickly* retrieve relevant documents based on their similarity to a query. 

This retrieval process is very similar to your KNN search! However, vector databases will implement Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms to speed up the search process -- ANN differs from KNN in that it does not guarantee the exact nearest neighbors, but rather a set of approximate nearest neighbors.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

There are many vector databases options available, such as:

## Store & Retrieve | ChromaDB

<div style="font-size: 0.9em">

ChromaDB is a vector database that stores embeddings and allows for fast text similarity search. ChromaDB is built on top of SQLite and provides a simple API for storing and retrieving embeddings.

### 1. Initializing

Before using ChromaDB, you need to initialize a client and create a collection.

```python
import chromadb
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection('academic_integrity_nw')
```


<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

### 2. Storing Embeddings

Storing embeddings in ChromaDB is simple. You can store embeddings along with the original documents and ids.

```python
# Store embeddings in chromadb.
collection.add(embeddings = embeddings, documents = chunked_data, ids = [f"id.{i}" for i in range(len(chunked_data))])
```

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### 3. Retrieving Embeddings

You can retrieve embeddings from ChromaDB based on a query. ChromaDB will return the most similar embeddings (and the original text) to the query.

```python
# Get relevant documents from chromadb, based on a query.
query = "Can a student appeal?"
relevant_chunks = collection.query(query_embeddings = embedding_function([query]), n_results = 2)['documents'][0]

>>> ['A student may appeal any finding or sanction as specified by the school holding jurisdiction.',
     '6. Review of any adverse initial determination, if requested, by an appeals committee to whom the student has access in person.']

```

## Generate | LLM Overview

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for text generation because they can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; font-size: 0.8em;">

**Encoder-Decoder Models**: T5, BART.

Encoder-decoder models generate text by encoding the input text into a fixed-size vector and then decoding the vector into text. Used in machine translation and text summarization.

**Encoder-Only**: BERT

Encoder-only models encode the input text into a fixed-size vector. These models are powerful for text classification tasks but are not typically used for text generation.

**Decoder-Only**: GPT-4, GPT-3, Gemini

Autoregressive models generate text one token at a time by conditioning on the previous tokens. Used in text generation, language modeling, and summarization.
